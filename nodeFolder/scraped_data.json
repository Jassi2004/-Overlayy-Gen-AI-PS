traditions1 It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force2 Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 1 a principle of evil independent from God 2 an aspect of God 3 a created being turning evil a fallen angel and 4 a symbol of human evil3 23 23 Each tradition culture and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil4 The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology mythology psychiatry art and literature developing independently within each of the traditions5 It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures and is given many different namesSatan Lucifer Beelzebub Mephistopheles Iblisand attributes it is portrayed as blue black or red it is portrayed as having horns on its head and without horns and so on67 While depictions of the devil are usually taken seriously there are times when it is treated less seriously when for example devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers48 The Modern English word devil derives from the Middle English devel from the Old English dofol that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of the Latin diabolus This in turn was borrowed from the Greek dibolos slanderer9 from diabllein to slander from di across through and bllein to hurl probably akin to the Sanskrit gurate he lifts up10 In his book The Devil Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings and difficulties that are encountered when using the term devil He does not claim to define the word in a general sense but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his booklimited in order to minimize this difficulty and for the sake of clarity In this book Russell uses the word devil as the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures as opposed to the word Satan which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions11 In the Introduction to his book Satan A Biography Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as devil and Satan etc While not offering a general definition he describes that in his book whenever diabolos is used as the proper name of Satan he signals it by using small caps12 The Oxford English Dictionary has a variety of definitions for the meaning of devil supported by a range of citations Devil may refer to Satan the supreme spirit of evil or one of Satans emissaries or demons that populate Hell or to one of the spirits that possess a demoniac person devil may refer to one of the malignant deities feared and worshiped by heathen people a demon a malignant being of superhuman powers figuratively devil may be applied to a wicked person or playfully to a rogue or rascal or in empathy often accompanied by the word poor to a personpoor devil13 In the Bah Faith a malevolent superhuman entity such as a devil or satan is not believed to exist14 However these terms do appear in the Bah writings where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man Human beings are seen to have free will and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their selfcentered desires Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bah writings with the word satanic14 The Bah writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the insistent self or lower self which is a selfserving inclination within each individual Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of the Evil One1516 In Christianity the devil or Satan is a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God1718 Some Christians also considered the Roman and Greek deities to be devils67 Christianity describes Satan as a fallen angel who terrorizes the world through evil17 is opposed to truth19 and shall be condemned together with the fallen angels who follow him to eternal fire at the Last Judgment17 In mainstream Christianity the devil is usually referred to as Satan This is because Christian beliefs in Satan are inspired directly by the dominant view of Second Temple Judaism recorded in the Enochian books as expressedpracticed by Jesus and with some minor variations Some modern Christians who consider the devil to be an angel who along with onethird of the angelic host the demons rebelled against God and has consequently been condemned to the Lake of Fire He is described attribution needed as hating all humanity or more accurately all creation opposing God spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls who attribution needed In the Bible the devil is identified as the dragon and the old serpent in the Book of Revelation21 as the prince of this world in the Gospel of John22 the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in the Epistle to the Ephesians23 and the god of this world in 2 Corinthians 4424 He is also identified as the tempter of the Gospels25 Satan is traditionally identified as the serpent who convinced Eve to eat the forbidden fruit thus Satan has often been depicted as a serpent Beelzebub is originally the name of a Philistine god more specifically a certain type of Baal from Baal Zebb lit Lord of Flies but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for the devil26 A corrupted version Belzeboub appears in The Divine Comedy Inferno XXXIV In other nonmainstream Christian beliefs eg the beliefs of the Christadelphians the word satan in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural personal being but to any adversary and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation27 In the Book of Wisdom the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world28 The Second Book of Enoch contains references to a Watcher called Satanael29 describing him as the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven30 and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was righteous and sinful31 In the Book of Jubilees Satan rules over a host of angels32 Mastema who induced God to test Abraham through the sacrifice of Isaac is identical with Satan in both name and nature33 The Book of Enoch contains references to Sathariel thought also by whom to be Sataniel and Satanel The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren Michael Raphael Uriel and Gabriel previous to his expulsion from Heavencitation needed by whom citation needed Gnostic and Gnosticinfluenced religions postulate the idea that the material world is inherently evil The One true God is remote beyond the material universe therefore this universe must be governed by an inferior imposter deity This deity was identified with the deity of the Old Testament by some sects such as the Sethians and the Marcions Tertullian accuses Marcion of Sinope that he mwparseroutput

faithful and accounted for it by postulating that Jehovah was a secondary deity a demiurgus who was god in a sense but not the supreme God he was just rigidly just he had his good qualities but he was not the good god who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ34 John Arendzen 1909 in the Catholic Encyclopedia 1913 mentions that Eusebius accused Apelles the 2ndcentury AD Gnostic of considering the Inspirer of Old Testament prophecies to be not a god but an evil angel35 These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as a demiurgus34 to distinguish him from the One true God Some texts such as the Apocryphon of John and On the Origin of the World not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings Samael36 In the 12th century in Europe the Cathars who were rooted in Gnosticism dealt with the problem of evil and developed ideas of dualism and demonology The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time The Cathars split into two camps The first is absolute dualism which held that evil was completely separate from the good God and that God and the devil each had power The second camp is mitigated dualism which considers Lucifer to be a son of God and a brother to Christ To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son with Christ as the good son and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness The Catholic Church responded to dualism in AD 1215 in the Fourth Lateran Council saying that God created everything from nothing and the devil was good when he was created but he made himself bad by his own free will3738 In the Gospel of the Secret Supper Lucifer just as in prior Gnostic systems appears as a demiurge who created the material world39 In Islam the principle of evil is expressed by two terms referring to the same entity404142 Shaitan meaning astray distant or devil and Iblis Iblis is the proper name of the devil representing the characteristics of evil43 Iblis is mentioned in the Quranic narrative about the creation of humanity When God created Adam he ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before him Out of pride Iblis refused and claimed to be superior to AdamQuran 712 Therefore pride but also envy became a sign of unbelief in Islam43 Thereafter Iblis was condemned to Hell but God granted him a request to lead humanity astray44 knowing the righteous would resist Iblis attempts to misguide them In Islam both good and evil are ultimately created by God But since Gods will is good the evil in the world must be part of Gods plan45 Actually God allowed the devil to seduce humanity Evil and suffering are regarded as a test or a chance to prove confidence in God45 Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God Because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves Iblis was forced to choose between Gods command and Gods will not to praise someone other than God He successfully passed the test yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering However he stays patient and is rewarded in the end46 Muslims hold that the preIslamic jinn tutelary deities became subject under Islam to the judgment of God and that those who did not submit to the law of God are devils47 Although Iblis is often compared to the devil in Christian theology Islam rejects the idea that Satan is an opponent of God and the implied struggle between God and the devilclarification needed Iblis might either be regarded as the most monotheistic or the greatest sinner but remains only a creature of God Iblis did not become an unbeliever due to his disobedience but because of attributing injustice to God that is by asserting that the command to prostrate himself before Adam was inappropriate48 There is no reference to angelic revolt in the Quran and no mention of Iblis trying to take Gods throne4950 and Ibliss sin could be forgiven at any time by God51 According to the Quran Ibliss disobedience was due to his disdain for humanity a narrative already occurring in early New Testament apocrypha52 clarification needed As in Christianity Iblis was once a pious creature of God but later cast out of Heaven due to his pride However to maintain Gods absolute sovereignty53 Islam matches the line taken by Irenaeus instead of the later Christian consensus that the devil did not rebel against God but against humanity5441 Further although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity55 he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity Iblis is merely a tempter notable for inciting humans into sin by whispering into humans minds wasws akin to the Jewish idea of the devil as yetzer hara5657 On the other hand Shaitan refers unilaterally to forces of evil including the devil Iblis who causes mischief58 Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature appearing in dreams causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer55 Furthermore the term Shaitan also refers to beings who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis Also the principle of shaitan is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity representing humans own deficits in contrast to a true Muslim who is free from anger lust and other devilish desires59 In Muslim culture devils are believed to be hermaphrodite creatures created from hellfire with one male and one female thigh and able to procreate without a mate It is generally believed that devils can harm the souls of humans through their whisperings While whisperings tempt humans to sin the devils might enter the hearth qalb of an individual If the devils take over the soul of a person this would render them aggressive or insane60 In extreme cases the alterings of the soul are believed to have effect on the body matching its spiritual qualities61 In contrast to Occidental philosophy the Sufi idea of seeing Many as One and considering the creation in its essence as the Absolute leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the external substantial objects The rebellion against God mentioned in the Quran takes place on the level of the psyche that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the spirit that is pure Since psyche drives the body flesh is not the obstacle to humans but rather an unawareness that allows the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche Yet it is not a dualism between body psyche and spirit since the spirit embraces both psyche and corporeal aspects of humanity62 Since the world is held to be the mirror in which Gods attributes are reflected participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God56 The devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche leading the human astray from the Divine63 Thus it is the I that is regarded as evil and both Iblis and Pharao are present as symbols for uttering I in ones own behavior Therefore it is recommended to use the term I as little as possible It is only God who has the right to say I since it is only God who is selfsubsistent Uttering I is therefore a way to compare oneself to God regarded as shirk64 Salafi strands of Islam commonly emphasize a dualistic worldview contrasting believers and unbelievers65 and featuring the devil as the enemy of the faithful who tries to lead them astray from Gods path Even though the devil will eventually be defeated by God he remains a serious and dangerous opponent of humans66 While in classical hadiths the demons Shayateen and the jinn are responsible for impurity and capable of endangering human souls in Salafi thought it is the devil himself who lies in wait for believers67 always striving to lure them away from God The devil is regarded as an omnipresent entity permanently inciting humans into sin but can be pushed away by remembering the name God68 The devil is regarded as an external entity threatening the everyday life of the believer even in social aspects of life69 Thus for example it is the devil who is responsible for Western emancipation70 Yahweh the god in preexilic Judaism created both good and evil as stated in Isaiah 457 I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things The devil does not exist in Jewish scriptures However the influence of Zoroastrianism during the Achaemenid Empire introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief system which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term satan developed into a specific type of supernatural entity changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one71 Later Rabbinic Judaism rejectedwhen the Enochian books written during the Second Temple period under Persian influence which depicted the devil as an independent force of evil besides God72 After the apocalyptic period references to Satan in the Tanakh are thoughtby whom to be allegorical73 when by whom In Mandaean mythology Ruha fell apart from the World of Light and became the queen of the World of Darkness also referred to as Sheol747576 She is considered evil and a liar sorcerer and seductress77 541 She gives birth to Ur also referred to as Leviathan He is portrayed as a large ferocious dragon or snake and is considered the king of the World of Darkness75 Together they rule the underworld and create the seven planets and twelve zodiac constellations75 Also found in the underworld is Krun the greatest of the five Mandaean Lords of the underworld He dwells in the lowest depths of creation and his epithet is the mountain of flesh78 251 Prominent infernal beings found in the World of Darkness include lilith nalai vampire niuli hobgoblin latabi devil gadalta ghost satani Satan and various other demons and evil spirits7574 541 251 In Manichaeism God and the devil are two unrelated principles God created good and inhabits the realm of light while the devil also called the prince of darkness7980 created evil and inhabits the kingdom of darkness The contemporary world came into existence when the kingdom of darkness assaulted the kingdom of light and mingled with the spiritual world81 At the end the devil and his followers will be sealed forever and the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness will continue to coexist eternally never to commingle again82 Hegemonius 4th century CE accuses that the Persian prophet Mani founder of the Manichaean sect in the 3rd century CE identified Jehovah as the devil god which created the world83 and said that he who spoke with Moses the Jews and the priests is the Prince of Darkness not the god of truth7980 Among the Tengristic myths of central Asia Erlik refers to a devillike figure as the ruler of Tamag Hell who was also the first human According to one narrative Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters When God was about to create the Earth he sent Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud Erlik hid some inside his mouth to later create his own world But when God commanded the Earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the mud in his mouth God aided Erlik to spit it out The mud carried by Erlik gave place"
